<p>I like to pretend that I can just target the latest stable release of <code>perl</code> and that&#39;s that. It&#39;s what I run on my computers, after all. Unfortunately, at work, we have two different deployed versions, so I need to support those, too. But that&#39;s only two versions, right?</p>

<p>Well, not really. The problem is that I release as much of my code as seems reasonable to the CPAN, and that means I get bug reports from lots of different versions. My least favorite five words? &quot;It doesn&#39;t work on 5.8.1.&quot; (You may be thinking, &quot;Why 5.8.1 and not 5.6.1?&quot; Well, because if it&#39;s 5.6.1, I&#39;ll usually send condolences instead of bugfixes.)</p>

<p>So, what do I do when I get that bug report? If it looks like a plausible bug (and not an obvious user error), my next action is almost always to see whether I can reproduce it. If the bug really is just in 5.8.1, and I can&#39;t reproduce it in my 5.14.1, or the 5.8.8 readily available on some other box sitting around, I&#39;ll have to buck up and install 5.8.1.</p>

<p>The last thing I want, though, is to end up with a zillion <code>perl5.x.y</code> binaries in my path, each partially sharing its library paths, different installs of this or that being alternately shared or not shared between interpreters. It&#39;s pretty easy to get that with the right arguments to the <i>Configure</i> program that builds <code>perl</code> &ndash; oh, and right. I&#39;d have to <i>run</i> the <i>Configure</i> program, build, test, install, and so on. Some versions would need patches to build on my OS X box. What a drag.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I am free from having to suffer through any of this, because I can use <code><a href="http://perlbrew.pl">perlbrew</a></code> from <a href="https://metacpan.org/author/GUGOD">gugod</a>. It manages a bunch of parallel Perl installs. If you&#39;re familiar with Ruby&#39;s <code><a href="http://beginrescueend.com/">rvm</a></code>, then you already know what <code>perlbrew</code> is, more or less.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t, here&#39;s how you get started &ndash; we&#39;ll talk about how you use it in a bit, if you&#39;re not sure you want to install it, but you can trust me: you do.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>install App::perlbrew with your favorite CPAN client (cpan, cpanp, cpanm, ppm, whatever)</p>

</li>
<li><p>run <code>perlbrew init</code></p>

<p>This will print out a big friendly message saying what it did, and it will include one key line, something like:</p>

<pre><code>  source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc</code></pre>

</li>
<li><p>add that <code>source</code> line to your <i>~/.bashrc</i> or <i>.zshrc</i> or whatever</p>

<p>Now when you open a new shell, it will look for stuff installed into <code>perlbrew</code>-managed Perl environment instead of the global system environment first.</p>

</li>
<li><p>run <code>perlbrew install perl-5.14.2</code></p>

<p>Now <code>perlbrew</code> will start doing the first hunk of boring that you&#39;re getting to avoid: configuring, building, testing, and installing <code>perl</code> v5.14.2. If it knows that it will have to patch the source to compile (by using <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Devel-PatchPerl">Devel-PatchPerl</a>, it will. It will give the <code>perl</code> its <i>entirely self-contained</i> set of <code>@INC</code> libraries, install paths, and so on. <i>No libraries</i> are getting shared with your system <code>perl</code>, and it won&#39;t leak the other way, either.</p>

</li>
<li><p>do something fun while it compiles</p>

<p>Or, if you think it&#39;s fun, you can tail the log file &ndash; <code>perlbrew</code> will have told you its path &ndash; to see how the build is going.</p>

</li>
<li><p>open a new shell (or run that <code>source</code> line in this one)</p>

</li>
<li><p>run <code>perlbrew switch perl-5.14.2</code> to make it your active perl</p>

</li>
<li><p>run <code>perl -v</code> and rejoice</p>

<p>(Remember that if you just sourced that file in an existing shell like <code>zsh</code>, you might need to run <code>rehash</code>!)</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p>So, great, you have <code>perl</code>. So what?</p>

<p>Well, go ahead and repeat steps 4 through 8, picking another version. You&#39;ll end up with several installed Perl environments, each with its own libraries. Not only that, but you&#39;ll have <code>cpanm</code> preinstalled. So, someone told you that your Awesome::Library is busted on 5.8.9?</p>



<table class='code-listing'><tr><td class='line-numbers'><br /><code>1:&nbsp;<br />2:&nbsp;</code><br />&nbsp;</td><td class='code'><br /><code>$ perlbrew switch perl-5.8.9<br />$ cpanm -v Awesome::Library</code><br />&nbsp;</td></table>

<p>...and you&#39;ll see the build process occur right there in your own 5.8.9 install.</p>

<p><i>One warning</i>: trying this out, you may find some versions won&#39;t compile for you. Not every version still compiles cleanly with modern libraries and tools. PatchPerl, included with <code>perlbrew</code> should take care of this, but it doesn&#39;t handle everything. For example, on Mac OS X 10.7, probably only 5.14.2 will compile. These tend to get addressed eventually, but it won&#39;t ever be perfect.</p>

<p>You can install more than one copy of any given perl, too. Maybe you want to have different sets of libraries installed &ndash; although really you could just use <a href="http://perladvent.org/2011/2011-12-01.html">local::lib</a> for that. Maybe, though, you want the same version with different options. These are all useful:</p>

<pre><code>  perlbrew install perl-5.14.2 -Dusethreads --as threaded-5.14.2

  perlbrew install perl-5.14.2 -DDEBUGGING --as debug-5.14.2</code></pre>

<p>...and you probably want to know that <code>-j</code> works to make and test in parallel:</p>

<pre><code>  perlbrew install -j 5 perl-5.14.2</code></pre>

<h2 id="Take-your-perl-and-roll-it-back">Take your perl and roll it back</h2>

<p>If you really need to make <code>which perl</code> start returning your old global perl or its installed programs &ndash; which should probably never happen &ndash; you can get <code>perlbrew</code> out of the way with <code>perlbrew off</code>.</p>

<p>Of course, you probably don&#39;t need to do this. If you&#39;ve got <code>perl</code> installed for your system at <i>/usr/bin/perl</i> you can just put that in the shebang lines as needed. You can run <code>/usr/bin/perl $(which cpanm)</code> when you need to install things to the global install, and so on. Almost certainly, though, you&#39;ll quickly find that you don&#39;t need to muck with it nearly at all.</p>

<p>More likely, you&#39;ll start finding that you&#39;ve got personal scripts that are using the system perl in their shebang, but your library updates are now going to perlbrew. That&#39;s easy to fix, and you do some nice simple things this way. For example, you can write this:</p>



<table class='code-listing'><tr><td class='line-numbers'><br /><code>1:&nbsp;<br />2:&nbsp;<br />3:&nbsp;<br />4:&nbsp;<br />5:&nbsp;<br />6:&nbsp;</code><br />&nbsp;</td><td class='code'><br /><code><span class="comment">#!/home/rjbs/perl5/perlbrew/perls/perl-5.14.2/bin/perl<br /></span><span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="version">5.14.1</span><span class="structure">;</span><br /><br /><span class="keyword">use</span> <span class="word">local::lib</span> <span class="single">'/home/rjbs/.perlbrew/lib/safe'</span><span class="structure">;</span><br /><br /><span class="operator">...</span></code><br />&nbsp;</td></table>

<p>First of all, you&#39;ve spelled out exactly what version of <code>perl</code> to use, and that won&#39;t go away when you install a new version -- it will stay there, working correctly, until you get everything working on 5.16 and (maybe) decide to delete your <code>perl</code>.</p>

<p>Secondly, you&#39;ve decided to use a local::lib to keep the safe versions of all the libraries you&#39;re going to use. Why is it under <i>~/.perlbrew</i>? Because <code>perlbrew</code> can manage your local::lib compartments, too:</p>



<table class='code-listing'><tr><td class='line-numbers'><br /><code>1:&nbsp;<br />2:&nbsp;<br />3:&nbsp;<br />4:&nbsp;</code><br />&nbsp;</td><td class='code'><br /><code>$ perlbrew switch perl-5.14.2<br />$ perlbrew lib create safe<br />$ perlbrew switch perl-5.14.2@safe<br />$ cpanm install Something::Cool</code><br />&nbsp;</td></table>

<p>In other words, we:</p>

<ol>

<li><p>pick the perl for we want a local::lib</p>

</li>
<li><p>create a local::lib compartment called &quot;safe&quot; for that perl</p>

</li>
<li><p>switch to using it</p>

</li>
<li><p>install Something::Cool into it</p>

</li>
</ol>

<p>There are some limitations, here. We can only have one active compartment at a time and we can&#39;t re-use a compartment across two versions (even if we think it will be safe). Still, those are unlikely cases, and the base case is very, very useful.</p>

<h2 id="Doesnt-it-make-your-life-better-">Doesn&#39;t it make your life better?</h2>

<p>It&#39;s hard to explain how much simpler <code>perlbrew</code> can make testing of Perl code. It&#39;s not just testing, either. Obviously, this makes it easier to upgrade your code to a new version without having to go whole hog or have multiple versions installed in a single <i>bin</i> dir. It lets you keep your one stupid-but-vital ancient tool working on 5.6 while the rest of your work is getting done on 5.14.</p>

<p>Finally, even if you only ever use it for one <code>perl</code>, it takes away a bunch of the headache of installing <code>perl</code> and later libraries by doing all the configuration for you and putting everything into directories into which you can write, without <code>sudo</code> or local::lib.</p>

<p>You will not regret using <code>perlbrew</code>.</p>
